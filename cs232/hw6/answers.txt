1. Does your program run the same way each time? Why?

No it doesn't because the threads may get scheduled to run in a different order each time this program gets run. Generally it seems
that lower numbered threads go first, while higher numbered threads go later. This might be due to the for loop where these threads
are getting created as they are created from lowest to highest in number. But there are times when a more random order of threads appears.

2. Give your last customer thread the highest priority. Does this ensure that this customer is always given first priority? Why or why not?

The last customer is not always given first priority even if it has the highest thread priority. This might be because that since it is the last thread,
by the time it gets created and ready to run, there would already be a lot of threads running. These running threads would probably have acquired a bunch
of semaphore locks that the highest priority thread would need in order to run. Hence, the highest priority thread may be allowed to run more often on the
CPU, but it can do nothing but wait until those semaphores it needs get released for it to use to finally proceed.
